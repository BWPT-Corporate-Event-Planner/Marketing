## Proposal ##

* What problem does your app solve?
* Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
* What is the mission statement?

## Features ##

* What features are required for your minimum viable product?
* What features may you wish to put in a future release?
* What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

## Frameworks - Libraries ##

* What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
* Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
* Are you required to pay to use the API?
* Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)

## For Data Scientists ##


* Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
* You can gather information about the data set youâ€™ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
* Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
* A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app
